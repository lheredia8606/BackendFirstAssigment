# Part 2: Query Practice

To complete part 2, run `npm run test-2` and follow through this readme until you pass all of the tests.

In this section we're going to practice getting some queries written.
*note: **only work on part 2 if you have already completed part 1 or you WILL HAVE A BAD TIME***

a: write a query that selects all columns on all dogs
 
 - write your answer in `part2/a.sql`

b:
write a query that only selects name on all dogs and orders them descending by name
 
 - write your answer in `part2/b.sql`
 
c:
write a query that selects a dog where the name is "DOOMSLAYER"
 
 - write your answer in `part2/c.sql`

d:
Write a query to select all users' first and last names that favorited the dog with the name "Zoey"
 
 - write your answer in `part2/d.sql`
 - hint: you will need a join
